This is a blogdown website that analyzes the relationship between the population in the neighbourhoods of Toronto and their aggregate criminal activity.

# Abstract

Crime has become a frequent occurrence in major metropolitan cities with huge populations. In this blog post, we will analyze the crime rates in the city of Toronto to see the changes in criminal activity over the years (2014-2019). We will group our observations by population size of different neighbourhoods in Toronto to examine if population and criminal activity has any statistical correlation. Finally, we will fit a Simple Linear Regression (SLR) model and perform hypothesis testing to verify our results.
